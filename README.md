## [Freetype font rendering](Projects/FontRendering)

The fonts texture were generated using Freetype2 library. The texture format that is generated by freetype is VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM
For each glyph a texture is generated and put it into descriptors list. Of course it very bad thing to do.
The best thing is to have one texture for all glyps and point to specific char UV coordinates. In order to have alpha enabled you need
to enable blending in your VkPipeline.
First one is using signed distance field, the second one(down) does not use signed distance field.
There are still some strange edge bleeding which I do not know really why.

Shader - [Static Model Shader](Assets/Shaders/StaticModel)
There are issues with normal mapping. Shader is not complete.
Using TBN Matrix convert view vector and light vector to tangent space. Doing this results in black model.
Using my own wavefront parser.

Project is not finnished
Using my own MD5 parser.
