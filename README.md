# TywRenderer

Vulkan Renderer. Work in progress.
- Warning. Take the code with grain of salt as it might violate Vulkan specs.
- Big Warning. Some of resources are not freed correctly. Work in progress...
- Always happy to hear what could be fixed or improved.

#How to Build
Currently works only under windows.
Run .bat file which will build vs2015 solution

In order to get working. You need to have working Vulkan driver and Vulkan SDK that you can download from LunarG site
- LunarG Vulkan SDK - https://lunarg.com/
- More information about glsllang - https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glslang
- More information about validation layer - https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-LoaderAndValidationLayers

## [Freetype font rendering](Projects/FontRendering)
<img src="ScreenShots/FontRendering.png" height="126px" align="right">
The fonts texture were generated using Freetype2 library. The texture format that is generated by freetype is VK_FORMAT_R8_UNORM
For each glyph a texture is generated and put it into descriptors list. Of course it very bad thing to do.
The best thing is to have one texture for all glyps and point to specific char UV coordinates. In order to have alpha enabled you need
to enable blending in your VkPipeline.
First one is using signed distance field, the second one(down) does not use signed distance field.
There are still some strange edge bleeding which I do not know really why.

Shader - [Static Model Shader](Assets/Shaders/StaticModel)
There are issues with normal mapping. Shader is not complete.
Using TBN Matrix convert view vector and light vector to tangent space. Doing this results in black model.
Using my own wavefront parser.


## [Skeletal Animation](Projects/SkeletalAnimation)
<img src="ScreenShots/SkeletalAnimation.gif" height="126px" align="right">
Shader (should be renamed to gpu instead of cpu... cuz gpu skinning it is) - [Static Model Shader](Assets/Shaders/SkeletalAnimation)
GPU skinning of MD5 file. MD5 file usually have less then 9 bones per vertex (usually max is 4 in game industry), so had to setup second vec4 for boneWeight and jointId. Also, glm does not handle well small angles so had to use different version of slerp which would handle small angles. Some info about getting MD5 rendering part is here -> https://github.com/gszauer/3DAnimation/blob/master/MD5/README.md

## [Shadow Mapping](Projects/ShadowMapping)
At the moment it is experimental. Not working properly. Have resource leaks and other problems with shadow rendering.
